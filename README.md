App launcher is an app/link laucher, similar to what is seen in google's recent redesign.  

The javaScript is designed to be fast and light.  No frameworks are used, and it is cross browser compatible.  

Instructions are included in the docs folder.  

Also can be viewed @ http://shidel.com/#gLauncher.

Enjoy!
